      #'''Q1. To comment a code we use # for one line comments .. to comment multiple lines of comment we do is 
we use the three colon line as in this first question answer i am using.. 
in code also inside function we can mention the doc string using three colon line as in this case we have done..
'''
"we can also comment using single quote marks as in this examples "
"""we can also comment using double quote marks as mentioned...
so there are four ways.. 
1. #  
2. ""(single quotes )
3. ""double quotes"" 
4. '''doc strings...''', """


#Q2.
'''variables are names to the placeholder for the memory location where we have integer float or string or any other types of data we can store, 
such as n = 5 so n is name which points to memory location where 5 is stored .. similarly, we have 
n1 = 3.5567 or stringsss = 'pw'  
we also use the term object for the data .. to which these variables are the refrences.'''
"in python we declare the variables using simple name of variables and assignment operators, "
"say n = 5.5 later we can assign some other types of data to the same varibles.. "
"like n = 'pwskills' and n = 2 so first float then string and then integers values so whatever varibles we need we can declare immediately and assign values or take the inputs from the user"

#Q3.
#to convert to any other data type we just have to use python built in function with that data type names.. 
x = 5
y = float(x) #convert to float
z1 = str(x) #conver to string..
print(x, y, z1)



#Q4.
'''first of create a file say in vs code and then write the code as i m writing it,
then save it and then go to that path like where the file is stored and then 
execute the command py .\nameofthefile.py so the code in the given file will start 
executing immmediately....'''

#Q5.
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(list1[1:3])
#Q6
'''complex numbers are basically combination of real numbers and imaginary numbers we can 
represent complex no in python as numbr = 5+5j where 5 is real no while the 5j is imaginary no..
'''
complex1 = 4 + 6j
complex2 = 5 + 80j
print(complex1)

#Q7..
age = 25 
#we hve declare age as variable and 25 is integer data object and age is refrencing or point to that object.. 

#Q8
price = 9.99
print(type(price))
#type is of float 

#Q9
name = "NItish kumar singh"
print(name)
#Q10
str1 = "Hello World!"
print(str1[6:11])

#Q11
is_student = True #this indicates yes is_student is true ..
is_student = False #this indicates not a student.. boolean varialbes
